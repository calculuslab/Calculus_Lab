    "## The Problem: Designing a Roller Coaster\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are asked to design a simple ascent and drop roller coaster with an overall horizontal displacement of 200 feet. By studying pictures of our favorite roller coasters, we decide that our roller coater should begin the ascent along a line $y = f_1(x)$ of slope 1.5 for the first 20 ft horizontally. Next, it should continue the ascent and then begin the drop along a parabola $y = f_2(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for the next 100 ft horizontally. Finally, we want it to begin a soft landing at 30 ft above the ground along a cubic $y = f_3(x) = dx^3 + ex^2 + fx + g$ for the last 80 ft. The main task is to find $\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}$ that will ensure that the track is smooth at each transition point. We also would like to know the maximum height of the roller coaster."
